# 605project
STAT605 class project at University of Wisconsin-Madison.
The purpose of our project is to ﬁnd potential cholesterol genes using parallel computing through CHTC. 
Two diﬀerent datasets, one is about human genes and one is about mouse genes are analyzed. 
We calculated biweight midcorrelation between gene “LDLR” and other genes, and deﬁned highly correlated ones as potential cholesterol genes.

## Link to the datasets

- [gene datasets] https://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/archs4/download.html )

## Code

The code folder includes codes run in CHTC.

## Data

The data folder includes the human_best100.csv and mouse_best100.csv, which are the top 100 genes most correlated with LDLA and their bicorrelation and p-values.
The data folder also includes the columns of LDLR and top 10 most correlated genes stetched from raw data. It is used in the report.rmd file for plots in analysis.

## Figures

The figures folder includes the plots from Rmd, which show the distribution of LDLR compared with other genes.

## Results

The result folder includes the human_best100.csv and mouse_best100.csv, which are the top 100 genes most correlated with LDLA and their bicorrelation and p-values.

## Others

There are also files of our presentation and reports in our github.
